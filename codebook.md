DATA DICTIONARY


Signals used to estimate variables of the vector for each pattern:
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ 
tGravityAcc-XYZ 
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ 
tBodyGyro-XYZ 
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ 
tBodyAccMag 
tGravityAccMag 
tBodyAccJerkMag 
tBodyGyroJerkMag 
tBodyGyroMag 
fBodyAcc-XYZ 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ 
fBodyGyro-XYZ 
fBodyAccMag 
fBodyAccJerkMag 
fBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag 


angle(): Angle between two vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean 
tBodyAccMean 
tBodyAccJerkMean 
tBodyGyroMean 
tBodyGyroJerkMean

Feature Vector variables:

activity_id
activity_name
subject_id
mean()
std()
